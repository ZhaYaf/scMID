scMID 
a feature selection method based on the integration of single-cell multi-omics data and the dropout pattern.

The scMID model is implemented in Python 3.8 using the TensorFlow framework. Here, we provide kidney data which consists of paired chromatin accessibility data and transcriptome data from mammalian kidney cells as an example. You can execute the main.py file to run the scMID.
